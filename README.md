Search for an athlete by name. Prints meet results, comp PRs, and make rates.

```sh
meetcal search "Maddisen Mohnsen"
```

#### `wrapped`

Show an athlete's Weightlifting Wrapped for a calendar year. The report includes meets competed,
make rate, total weight lifted, best lifts, average total, top meet, first-to-last improvement,
longest make streak, favorite attempt, and year status.

```sh
meetcal wrapped "Maddisen Mohnsen"
